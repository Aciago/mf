data project "meme friday"

idea:
1) grab big quantities of img files from instagramm (or any other source)
2) post them for comfortable viewing in Telegramm
3) telegramm bot (?)

inspired by desire to avoid using IG, but interest in meme fridays of a friend. IG has limit of 100 stories\day, tons of img files are not optimal for TG.
